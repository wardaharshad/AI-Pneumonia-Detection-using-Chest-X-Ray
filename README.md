Libraries:
* PyQt5: PyQt is a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.

* win32com.client: The win32com.client package contains a number of modules to provide access to automation objects. Python has the “Python for Windows Extensions” package known as pywin32 that allows us to easily access Window's Component Object Model (COM) and control Microsoft applications.

* Dispatch method when passed with the argument of SAPI.SpVoice It interacts with the Microsoft Speech SDK to speak what you type in from the keyboard.

* The glob module is a useful part of the Python standard library. glob (short for global) is used to return all file paths that match a specific pattern.
We can use glob to search for a specific file pattern, or perhaps more usefully, search for files where the filename matches a certain pattern by using wildcard characters.
