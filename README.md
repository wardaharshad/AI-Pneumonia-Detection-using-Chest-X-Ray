Libraries:
*PyQt5: PyQt is a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.

*win32com.client: The win32com.client package contains a number of modules to provide access to automation objects. Python has the “Python for Windows Extensions” package known as pywin32 that allows us to easily access Window's Component Object Model (COM) and control Microsoft applications.
